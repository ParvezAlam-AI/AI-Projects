🚀**AI-Projects Hub: Exploring the Future of AI & LLMs**  
Welcome to AI-Projects – a cutting-edge repository dedicated to experimenting, testing, and building AI-powered applications.  
I am building this repository for all the non-tech and non-coders. 
Here, you'll find implementations of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI Agents, Agentic Workflows, and the latest advancements in AI research.  

This is your one-stop destination for exploring how AI models reason, interact, and automate tasks! 🔥  

📌 **What’s Inside?**  
This repository is a collection of AI experiments, projects, and workflows, including:  

⚡ **Local AI Deployments** – Running powerful LLMs like DeepSeek, LLaMA, Mistral, and Mixtral locally.  
🧠 **LLM Testing & Comparisons **– Exploring different Large Language Models in various environments.  
🤖** AI Agents & Agentic Workflows** – Designing autonomous agents that interact with tools, APIs, and users.  
🛠️ **AI-Powered Applications** – Implementing chatbots, automation tools, and intelligent assistants.
